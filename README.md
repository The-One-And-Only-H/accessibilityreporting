This script is for the automation of data extraction from accessibility reports

- Tools used: Lighthouse, Selenium, Bromine, ChromeDriver, Python

Lighthouse reports are autogenerated after the input of a specified URL, producing both the HTML and JSON version of the report
This script extracts only the required data from this report and exports it into a spreadsheet for better readability by devs

- npm install -g lighthouse
- Run this in the shell: `python reportdataextraction.py https://develop.bigwhitewall.com/ > report.csv`
- `url = https://develop.bigwhitewall.com/`
- `import subprocess`
- `data = subprocess.check_output(["./node_modules/.bin/lighthouse", url, "--output", "json"])`
