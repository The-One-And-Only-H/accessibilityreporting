This script is for the automation of data extraction from accessibility reports with Axe, which is autogenerated after the input of a specified list of URLs. This script extracts only the required data from this report and exports it into a spreadsheet for better readability by the development team.

- Run this in the shell: `python AxeReportGenerator.py`
- Or run this: `python AxeReportGenerator.py --visible` to see the browser

Remember to add your URLs as a yaml file to the end of the script before running, for example `python AxeReportGenerator.py urls.yaml`
